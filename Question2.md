#Student 2' answer to Question2
**Q2** Assign variables to the individual components of your favourite gene (e.g. promoter, 5' UTR, start codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3' UTR). Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator on the standard output! Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by randomly in the components.

,,,
promoter = "TATTTAAATTAAAAATT"
5_prime_UTR = "GTAATGTTGGGGAAAA"
start_codon = "ATG"
exon1 = "ATCCCGGGTTCGAACTG"
intron = "AATTTTTAAGGGGGAAAA"
exon2 = "GCATTAGTCCAATGAAG"
stop_codon = "TAG"
3_prime_UTR = "AAAATTAAAAAAAAAAA"

my_fav_gene = promoter + 5_prime_UTR + start_codon + exon1 + \
              intron + exon2 + stop_codon + 3_prime_UTR
        
print("My favourite gene sequence is as follows:")
print(my_favourite_gene)
